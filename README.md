# Deforestation-Exploration
As a data analyst for ForestQuery, I have been tasked with analyzing data to determine which countries and regions around the world are experiencing a decrease in forested areas, as well as identifying which countries and regions have the largest forest areas in terms of both total amount and percent of total area. By combining tables of forestation and total land area data into a database, I have been able to gather the necessary information to answer these questions. My findings will be presented in a report to the ForestQuery executive team, providing a comprehensive overview of global deforestation trends between 1990 and 2016.
